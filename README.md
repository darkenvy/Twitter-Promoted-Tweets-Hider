# Twitter Promotion Hide
A simple script for TamperMonkey to hide promoted tweets on twitter.

## How to use
This script is made for a product called Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey. It is a Chrome/Firefox extension that allows developers to inject scripts onto a page. To use this script, install Tampermonkey and import this script.

## Mobile
There are methods to get userscripts working on mobile devices, but this typically requires you to use a web browser to view Twitter. Not only that, but you would be using a different web-browser made specifically for userscript usage. Support for Chrome extensions on mobile is non-existant.
